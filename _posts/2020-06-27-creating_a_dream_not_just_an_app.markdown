Everyone in this generation wants to get rich quick and easy but no one really wants to show the time it took. I comtemplated for months what path I wanted to for my life career and everything I narrowed it down to always included freedom and technology. I studied and tried so hard to teach myself Data Science, but I failed two technical interviews and became very discouraged. I thought to myself maybe thatâ€™s just not the career for me and I needed to move on. After taking a few months off to regain the confidence of learning again I honed down on Software Engineering and took my first step into this journey.
